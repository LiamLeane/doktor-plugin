= Doktor

Doktor is a Jenkins plugin for automated documentation uploading to Confluence.

== Usage

As you might suspect, Confluence REST API requires authentication.
Doktor supports basic authentication (username and password).
So, first thing to do is to https://github.com/jenkinsci/credentials-plugin/blob/master/docs/user.adoc[configure credentials] in Jenkins.

Create a "Username with password" credentials to be used to authenticate on Confluence server:

You may have as many Confluence servers and credentials for them as you need.

Next thing to do is to configure Confluence servers.
Go to global configuration screen ("Manage Jenkins" -> "Configure System") and find "Confluence Servers" section.
Configure the list of available Confluence servers:

== Developing

Doktor is built with https://kotlinlang.org/[Kotlin], https://gradle.org/[Gradle] and Love.
Well, actually with hate to the workflows on my day-time job.

JPI artifact is produced with https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-jpi-plugin[Gradle's JPI plugin].
Read its documentation to know more about supported features and options.

Also, take a look at https://github.com/SimpleFinance/jenkins-firebase-test-plugin[this awesome Jenkins plugin], which is build with Gradle and Kotlin too!

=== Building & running

Basically, `./gradlew --rerun-tasks clean jpi server` will spin up a Jenkins with Doktor installed.
`--rerun-tasks` is used to force clean build every time because Gradle aggressively caches build outputs, especially https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/kapt.html[Kotlin annotation processing tool] results.
Feel free to tweak CLI arguments, assuming you know what you do.


Debug is supported as well:

----
GRADLE_OPTS="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005" ./gradlew --rerun-tasks clean jpi server
----


Omit `server` task if you just need a JPI file.

=== Testing Confluence integration

==== Cloud

Probably, the easiest (and CPU / RAM saving) way to run Confluence is to run it in the cloud (AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, ...).
Though, it will cost you some money.

There is an link:.ansible/confluence.yml[Ansible script] in this repo to automate Confluence installation.
It assumes that you already have a running instance that meets https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/system-requirements-126517514.html[Confluence's minimal system requirements].
Read your cloud provider's documentation to know how to create and manageVMs.

When you have a VM, just follow these steps to install Confluence Server:

. Create inventory file (`.ansible/inventory`) with a content like this:
+
----
[confluence]
your.confluence.host
----
+
You might want to add additional parameters.
For example, a set of parameters for Ubuntu 16.04 EC2 instance:
+
----
[confluence]
your.confluence.host ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/confluence.pem ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

----
+
Or you can just use http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_dynamic_inventory.html[dynamic inventories].

. After the inventory is configured, just run `./confluence.yml` from the `.ansible` directory.

. Go to `http://your.confluence.host/` (if the DNS and IPs are set) and configure the instance.
Note, that you will need a license key (trial works for 90 days).


==== Docker

You can run Confluence locally as well.
The easiest way here is https://www.docker.com/[Docker] (Windows uses should appreciate the joke).

Running Confluence is as simple as:

----
docker volume create --name confluence-data
docker run --detach --volume confluence-data:/var/atlassian/application-data/confluence --name confluence --publish-all atlassian/confluence-server:latest
----

You might want to add some https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/[additional options] or tweak the existing ones.

Note, that you will need a license key (trial works for 90 days).
