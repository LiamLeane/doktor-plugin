= Doktor

Doktor is a Jenkins plugin for automated documentation uploading to Confluence.

== Usage

=== Features

==== Supported formats

Doktor supports https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax[Markdown] and http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc].
Markdown support is provided by awesome https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java[flexmark-java] library.
AsciiDoc is supported thanks to https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctorj[AsciidoctorJ].
Please note that AsciiDoc support is very experimental.

==== Front matter

_Front matter_ is another word for _metadata_, used by bloggers and hipsters widely.

===== Markdown

Doktor uses http://www.yaml.org[YAML] front matter in your Markdown files.
Front matter looks like a small YAML fragment at the beginning of the file, separated by a triple minus sign (`---`) in this case:

[source,yml]
----
---
key: value
---
----

===== AsciiDoc

AsciiDoc provides native support for metadata via http://asciidoc.org/userguide.html#X18[attributes].
There is no actually a front matter section in this case:

[source, asciidoc]
----
:key: value
----

===== Supported attributes:

`title`::
Page title, unsurprisingly.

`parent`::
Parent page title, if any.

=== Configure Confluence servers

As you might suspect, Confluence REST API requires authentication.
Doktor supports basic authentication (username and password).
So, first thing to do is to https://github.com/jenkinsci/credentials-plugin/blob/master/docs/user.adoc[configure credentials] in Jenkins.

Create a "Username with password" credentials to be used to authenticate on Confluence server:

You may have as many Confluence servers and credentials for them as you need.

Next thing to do is to configure Confluence servers.
Go to global configuration screen ("Manage Jenkins" -> "Configure System") and find "Confluence Servers" section.
Configure the list of available Confluence servers:

Now, when you have some Confluence servers to publish documentation to, it's time test this plugin!
Yes, I'm using word "test" https://github.com/madhead/doktor/issues/new[intentionally] here.

=== Pipeline step

Using Doktor with https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline[pipelines] is very easy!
Here is the full syntax of `doktor` step:

[source,groovy]
----
doktor
	server : 'Cantina', // <1>
	markdownIncludePatterns: ['glob:**.md'], // <2>
	markdownExcludePatterns: ['glob:README.md'], // <3>
	asciidocIncludePatterns: ['glob:**.adoc', 'glob:**.asc'], // <4>
	asciidocExcludePatterns: ['glob:LICENSE.adoc', 'glob:CONTRIBUTING.asc'] // <5>
----
<1> One of the available Confluence servers
<2> List of Java 8 https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher-java.lang.String-[PathMatcher specifications] for https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax[Markdown] files to include.
<3> List of Java 8 https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher-java.lang.String-[PathMatcher specifications] for https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax[Markdown] files to exclude.
<4> List of Java 8 https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher-java.lang.String-[PathMatcher specifications] for http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc] files to include.
<5> List of Java 8 https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher-java.lang.String-[PathMatcher specifications] for http://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc] files to exclude.

You can also try your luck with "Snippet Generator", available at `/pipeline-syntax` path of your Jenkins installation.

=== Classic builds

Doktor plays nice with "classic" builds too!

Click those question icons on the right if you need any help.

== Developing

Doktor is built with https://kotlinlang.org[Kotlin], https://gradle.org[Gradle] and Love.
Well, actually with hate to the workflows on my day-time job.

JPI artifact is produced with https://github.com/jenkinsci/gradle-jpi-plugin[Gradle's JPI plugin].
Read its documentation to know more about supported features and options.

Also, take a look at https://github.com/SimpleFinance/jenkins-firebase-test-plugin[this awesome Jenkins plugin], which is build with Gradle and Kotlin too!

=== Building & running

Basically, `./gradlew --rerun-tasks clean jpi server` will spin up a Jenkins with Doktor installed.
`--rerun-tasks` is used to force clean build every time because Gradle aggressively caches build outputs, especially https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/kapt.html[Kotlin annotation processing tool] results.
Feel free to tweak CLI arguments, assuming you know what you do.

Debug is supported as well:

[source, bash]
----
GRADLE_OPTS="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005" ./gradlew --rerun-tasks clean jpi server
----

Omit `server` task if you just need a JPI file.

=== Testing Confluence integration

==== Cloud

Probably, the easiest (and CPU / RAM saving) way to run Confluence is to run it in the cloud (AWS EC2, DigitalOcean, ...).
Though, it will cost you some money.

There is an link:.ansible/confluence.yml[Ansible script] in this repo to automate Confluence installation.
It assumes that you already have a running instance that meets https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/system-requirements-126517514.html[Confluence's minimal system requirements].
Read your cloud provider's documentation to know how to create and manageVMs.

When you have a VM, just follow these steps to install Confluence Server:

. Create inventory file (`.ansible/inventory`) with a content like this:
+
[source, ini]
----
[confluence]
your.confluence.host
----
+
You might want to add additional parameters.
For example, a set of parameters for Ubuntu 16.04 EC2 instance:
+
[source, ini]
----
[confluence]
your.confluence.host ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/confluence.pem ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
----
+
Or you can just use http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_dynamic_inventory.html[dynamic inventories].

. After the inventory is configured, just run `./confluence.yml` from the `.ansible` directory.

. Go to `http://your.confluence.host/` (if the DNS and IPs are set) and configure the instance.
Note, that you will need a license key (trial works for 90 days).

==== Docker

You can run Confluence locally as well.
The easiest way here is https://www.docker.com[Docker] (Windows uses should appreciate the joke).

Running Confluence is as simple as:

[source, bash]
----
docker volume create --name confluence-data
docker run --detach --volume confluence-data:/var/atlassian/application-data/confluence --name confluence --publish-all atlassian/confluence-server:latest
----

You might want to add some https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run[additional options] or tweak the existing ones.

Note, that you will need a license key (trial works for 90 days).
