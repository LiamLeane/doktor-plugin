## Behavior

Guinea pigs can learn complex paths to food, and can accurately remember a learned path for months.
Their strongest problem-solving strategy is motion.
While guinea pigs can jump small obstacles, most of them are poor climbers, and are not particularly agile.
They startle extremely easily, and either freeze in place for long periods or run for cover with rapid, darting motions when they sense danger.
Larger groups of startled guinea pigs "stampede", running in haphazard directions as a means of confusing predators.
When excited, guinea pigs may repeatedly perform little hops in the air (known as "popcorning"), a movement analogous to the ferret's war dance.
They are also very good swimmers.
