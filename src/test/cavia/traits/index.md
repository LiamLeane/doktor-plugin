## Traits and environment

Guinea pigs are large for rodents, weighing between 700 and 1,200 g (1.5 and 2.6 lb), and measuring between 20 and 25 cm (8 and 10 in) in length.
Modern breeding of cuy guinea pigs has resulted in animals weighing 6 pounds (2.7 kg).
They typically live an average of four to five years, but may live as long as eight years.
According to the 2006 Guinness World Records, the longest living guinea pig survived 14 years, 10.5 months.
