== Domestic habitat

Domesticated guinea pigs thrive in groups of two or more; groups of sows, or groups of one or more sows and a neutered boar are common combinations.
Guinea pigs learn to recognize and bond with other individual guinea pigs, and testing of boars shows their neuroendocrine stress response is significantly lowered in the presence of a bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females.
Groups of boars may also get along, provided their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present.
Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between.
Activity is scattered randomly over the day; aside from avoidance of intense light, no regular circadian patterns are apparent.
