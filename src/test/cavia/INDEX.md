Why "cavia"?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig) says:

>Biological experimentation on guinea pigs (another name for cavias) has been carried out since the 17th century.
The animals were frequently used as model organisms in the 19th and 20th centuries, resulting in the epithet "guinea pig" for a test subject, but have since been largely replaced by other rodents such as mice and rats.
They are still used in research, primarily as models for human medical conditions such as juvenile diabetes, tuberculosis, scurvy, and pregnancy complications.**
