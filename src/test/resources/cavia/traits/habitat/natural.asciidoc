== Natural habitat

C. porcellus is not found naturally in the wild; it is likely descended from some closely related species of cavies, such as C. aperea, C. fulgida, and C. tschudii, which are still commonly found in various regions of South America.
Some species of cavy identified in the 20th century, such as C. anolaimae and C. guianae, may be domestic guinea pigs that have become feral by reintroduction into the wild.
Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an ecological niche similar to that of cattle.
They are social, living in the wild in small groups which consist of several females (sows), a male (boar), and the young (which in a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature are called pups).
They move together in groups (herds) eating grass or other vegetation, and do not store food.
While they do not burrow or build nests, they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals, as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation.
They tend to be most active during dawn and dusk, when it is harder for predators to spot them.
